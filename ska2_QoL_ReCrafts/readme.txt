-----------------------------------
Mod Version: 1.0


## Description:
"This is my mod. There are many like it but this one's mine. My mod is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my mod is useless. Without my mod, I am useless. I must keep my mod true. I must mod better than my enemy who is trying to out mod me. I must mod him before he mods me. My mod and myself are defenders of the game." -=-Jabberwocky-=-
