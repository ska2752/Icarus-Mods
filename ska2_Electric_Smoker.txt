-----------------------------------
Mod Version: 1.1


## Description:
"This is my mod. There are many like it but this one's mine. My mod is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my mod is useless. Without my mod, I am useless. I must keep my mod true. I must mod better than those who are trying to out mod me. I must mod him before he mods me. My mod and myself are defenders of the game." -=-Jabberwocky-=-

## Changes: 
v1.0
* Initial Release

v1.1
* Added the "EffectedByWeather": false
* Moved the blueprint to behind the Electricty Tool, it seems better placed after the tool it needs to be useful
* Increased the "BaseCraftingSpeed" to 50, this matches many other electric benches, stove, etc.
